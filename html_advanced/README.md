# Welcome to My Plant Shop Webpage Project!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the beginning of an exciting journey where I'll be creating a webpage from scratch, straight out of a designer file. This project is for a school assignment where I'll build a simple, yet semantic HTML webpage for selling plants.

# Project Overview

## What's the Plan?

I'll be diving into the HTML structure, focusing on making it solid and semantic. Think of it as setting up the foundation for a house, but in the virtual world. No worries about making things look pretty for now - that's a mission for another day.

# Objectives

## Let's break down what I'm aiming for:

HTML Structure: Building the bones of the webpage, creating a solid foundation for the online plant shop.
Semantics: Making the HTML make sense. Using semantic HTML elements gives meaning to the content, making it more understandable and accessible.
Image Integration: Adding a touch of visual appeal by integrating an image of the plants. I'll know where to place this image within the HTML structure.
