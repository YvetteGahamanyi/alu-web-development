# Welcome to My Plant Shop Webpage Project!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the beginning of an exciting journey where I'll be creating a webpage from scratch, straight out of a designer file. This project is for a school assignment where I'll build a simple, yet semantic HTML webpage for selling plants.

# Project Overview

# Webpage Functionalities

The webpage will include several key functionalities to provide a complete experience for users looking to buy plants:

## 1. Home Section

Welcome Message: A warm welcome to visitors with a brief introduction to the plant shop.
Overview of Offerings: Highlighting the variety of plants available for sale.

## 2. About Section

Shop Mission and Values: Information about the mission to bring greenery into homes and the values that drive the business.
Background Information: A bit about how the shop started and what makes it unique.

## 3. Plants Section

Plant Listings: A showcase of different plants available for sale. Each plant will have a brief description.
Image Integration: An image or gallery of plant images to visually represent the plants being sold.

## 4. Contact Section

Contact Information: Essential contact details such as email address, phone number, and physical address if applicable.
Contact Form: A simple form for customers to fill out for inquiries or orders (this will be a placeholder for now, as no backend will be implemented).

## 5. Navigation Menu

Links to Sections: Easy navigation through the webpage with links to the Home, About, Plants, and Contact sections.
Smooth Scrolling: Links will allow users to smoothly scroll to different parts of the webpage for a better user experience.

## 6. Footer Section

Copyright Information: A footer with the shopâ€™s name and the year to protect content.
Additional Links: Potential placeholders for social media links or additional resources in the future.
